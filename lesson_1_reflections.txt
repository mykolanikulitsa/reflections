How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It's very goog feature. It's simlifies development and saves my time. Thank you!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Helps me not to repeat previous mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    On my opinion it is more convenient to make committees manually, since you regulate it yourself. Where you need to unite several changes in one comet, and where for each change a new comit. and the best is that you yourself manage history and memory. I think that automatic can be better if you forgot to zakommit changes or there was an interruption of communication or something similar.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because the git was developed by developer for developers, and Google dock for another target audience

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    The git log command displays the history of all commits, and using the git diff command you can select the commit you are interested in and see what has changed in them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    So far not everything is so easy, since there are many teams, the sequence of the introduction of the team. new environment) but in general for the future it is an indispensable thing.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Its become more funny to work, not so dark. thank you. Next I want to try to make a repository.
