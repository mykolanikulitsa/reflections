When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you collaborate with somebody else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    That it was possible to work on different computers.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are good when you find a file, you can fork it and if the file is simple you can make the changes on GitHub servers without cloning file to th local. But all the forks will connect with original.
    After forking you can clone the repo to the local, make some changes and the original wouldn't know nothing about it.
    And branches is from different area. You can use master or you can create a testing branch for your features and than merge it with master if it will be useful.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit is that you can work on the project without internet.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Perhaps I would use other services for joint development. But Git and GitHab are unrealistically convenient for this.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
